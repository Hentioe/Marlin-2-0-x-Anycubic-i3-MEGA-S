## Hentioe's i3 MEGA S Firmware (Marlin 2.0.x)

Based on [Knutwurst's firmware](https://github.com/knutwurst/Marlin-2-0-x-Anycubic-i3-MEGA-S), a customized version for my own printer.

## Overview

This firmware upgrades the driver type to `TMC2209` and uses the original motor direction (since I reversed the jumper). and some other minor modifications.
